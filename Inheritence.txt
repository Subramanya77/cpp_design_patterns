INHERITANCE:
	1. Family of classes: 
	set of classes from same family(ex. Speed sensors is a family of sensors which has active and passive sensors).
	2. Separate common code from variation:
	Every class from family has a common code/functionality.
	3. Separate generalization from specialization:
	So keep the common code in a separate class and can be reused by other classes.
	4. Additive
	5. Inherits interface and Implementation
	6. Parent - child Relationship (real word analogy)
	7. Birth 

When Inheritance is called, compiler will ignore all constructor in base class and consider only default constructor. So always have a constructor using private.
